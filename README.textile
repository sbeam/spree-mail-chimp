h1. Spree + Mail Chimp 

MailChimp API integration for your Spree store, using the hominid gem.

Adds a checkbox to the user signup form to allow customer to opt-in to your Mailchimp mailing list. Mailchimp API calls happen via the hominid gem.

Mailchimp subscription status is tracked with a boolean flag on the users table, we also fetch and store the unique MC record id when the subscription is created. This allows us to modify existing email addresses with minimal fuss.

This is a very simple extension as of now, *any ideas suggestions or improvements welcome!*

h2. Subscription form partial with JS

Also includes a partial at <code>shared/newsletter_subscribe_form</code> that can be included in your footer or sidebar anywhere on the site, has one field for the email address. jQuery code in <code>public/javascripts/mailchimp_subscribe.js</code> will POST to the SubscriptionsController which will relay to Mailchimp. 

The SimpleModal plugin is used in the EJB to pop up a confirmation or error alert (because you won't be satisfied with a simple alert() box)

h3. Installation 

Add to project's Gemfile:
<pre><code>
gem 'mail_chimp', '>=1.3', :git => 'git://github.com/sbeam/spree-mail-chimp.git'
</code> </pre>

Run from project's root:
<pre><code>
rake mail_chimp:install

bundle install

rake db:migrate
</code> </pre>

h3. Configuration 

See the Mail Chimp Settings forms in the Admin under Configuration.

Note, using Mail Chimp "Merge Vars", you can have any callable methods on User sent
to the MC list, mapped to indentically named (but uppercased) fields in the MC list admin console. 
Unfortunately these are only sent at the time the subscription is created, so there isn't much available.
